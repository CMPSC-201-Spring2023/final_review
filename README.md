# CMPSC 201 Final Information

## Introduction

The exam will be released at 7pm on Friday, 5 May via GitHub. It will be due by midnight on the 5th of May 2023\. Following the process for lab assignments, you will be given a GitHub Classroom assignment link, you can then accept the assignment, clone the `final` repository, and find `final.md` file, which will contain the exam questions. You are invited to type your answers directly in this Markdown file. Continuous Integration will not be used in this repository. You should commit and push your work frequently. The last commit before the due time of midnight on May 5th will be graded.

The exam is open notes (hand written, typed, slides, programs, terminal, book). You are to abide by the college's Honor Code policy and the course's Code of Conduct while working on the exam. The answers will be checked for signs of plagiarism from the Internet.

The exam will cover all material up through this semester, concentrating more specifically on material since the midterm exam. The topics covered on the exam are listed below:

- _Programming Language Syntax_: Parsing and Derivation. Grammar, Shift Reduce, Ambiguity.

- _Name, Scope, and Binding_
  - Binding, scoping, binding time.
  - Static vs. dynamic scoping.
  - Hole in scope.
  - Storage management (stack vs. heap, heap allocation).

- _Control Flow_
  - Expression Evaluation.
  - Structured and Unstructured Flow.
  - Conditional branches.
  - Short circuit evaluation.
  - Iteration and Recursion.

- _Type System_

  - What makes a type system.
  - Strong/weak, dynamic/static typing.
  - Polymorphism.
  - Data types.
  - Composite types.

- _Subroutines_

  - Parameter Evaluation: normal order, lazy.
  - Exception handling.

- _Language Models_

  - Imperative vs. declarative languages.
  - Functional languages (key properties, lambda expression, composition, recursion, Haskell)
  - Object Oriented languages (key properties, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism).

- _Language Security_

  - Software security.
  - Software vulnerabilities.
  - Enforcing software security.

Questions will be aimed at basic understanding of concepts and the ability to apply them in concrete examples.

Question types will include:

- Short answer (may require analysis of a given code) - the majority of the questions.
- Multiple choice and True/false - a small minority of questions.

You will not be asked to write code; however, you may be given snippets of code for analysis in languages you have been exposed to during labs, class sessions and class activities.
